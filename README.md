# AI-Push_up-counter
This project is a Python-based application that utilizes OpenCV and computer vision techniques to detect body joints and landmarks in order to monitor and count push-ups in real-time. By analyzing specific key points, the program can track the movement of the user and automatically count the number of push-ups performed with proper form.

## Features:
- Real-time push-up detection using OpenCV.
- Joint and landmark tracking for movement analysis.
- Automatic push-up counting.

## Requirements:
- OpenCV
- cvzone
- NumPy
- Mediapipe

## Usage:
1. Install the required dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
2. Run the Python script to start the push-up detection.
3. Ensure your camera is properly set up for real-time video input.
